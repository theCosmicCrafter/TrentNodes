comfy node registry-install trentnodes
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/TrentHunter82/TrentNodes.git
cd TrentNodes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Nodes

All nodes are organized under the `Trent/` category for easy navigation.

### 📹 Trent/Video (6 nodes)

**Chop Cuts**
Accurate scene detection and video splitting. Automatically detects cuts, fades, and transitions using multi-metric analysis, then exports each scene as a separate MP4 file with a detailed report of cut locations and timestamps.

**Video Folder Analyzer**  
Scans directories for video files and generates detailed reports including resolution, frame rate, codec, duration, and file size. Outputs as text, JSON, or markdown.

**Latest Video Last N Frames**  
Extracts the final N frames from the most recently modified video in a specified directory. Useful for monitoring render outputs.

**Latest Video Final Frame**  
Retrieves the last frame from the newest video file in a folder. Streamlines iterative video generation workflows.

**Cross Dissolve with Overlap**  
Creates smooth frame transitions with configurable overlap duration. Blends adjacent frames for professional video effects.

**Enhanced Animation Timing Processor**  
Analyzes animation sequences to detect duplicate frames, timing patterns, and frame holds. Optimizes animation frame sequences.

### 🖼️ Trent/Image (4 nodes)

**Align Stylized Frame**
Aligns AI-stylized images back to their original subject position with pixel-perfect precision. Uses BiRefNet (BEN2) for high-quality subject segmentation, SD 1.5 inpainting for clean plate background generation, and area-based scaling with centroid positioning for accurate subject placement. Eliminates ghosting artifacts when compositing stylized subjects onto original backgrounds.

**Cherry Pick Frames**
Flexible frame selector with multiple modes for extracting specific frames from image batches. Supports first N frames, last N frames, specific indices (comma-separated like "0,5,10,75"), or every Nth frame. Dynamic outputs adjust based on your selection. Perfect for grabbing keyframes, endpoints, or evenly-spaced samples from video batches.

**Bevel/Emboss Effect**
Applies depth and dimensionality to images through configurable bevel and emboss filters. Includes adjustable angle, depth, and smoothing parameters.

**Image Batch Analyzer**
Comprehensive statistical analysis of image batches. Generates histograms, color distribution charts, and detailed reports on brightness, contrast, and color composition.

### 🔧 Trent/Utilities (7 nodes)

**Smart File Transfer (Auto-Rename)**  
Intelligent file management with automatic conflict resolution, checksums, and organized directory structures. Safely transfers files with duplicate detection.

**Custom Filename Generator**  
Creates structured filenames using templates with support for timestamps, counters, and metadata variables. Ensures consistent file naming across workflows.

**Filename Extractor**  
Parses filenames to extract embedded metadata, timestamps, and structured information. Converts filenames into usable workflow data.

**JSON → Multi-Line Summary**  
Converts complex JSON data into human-readable multi-line summaries. Formats nested structures for display and logging.

**JSON Extractor**  
Extracts specific values from JSON objects using path notation. Simplifies working with structured data in workflows.

**Number Counter**  
Generates sequential numbers with configurable start, step, and padding. Essential for batch processing and frame numbering.

**Wan2.1 Frame Adjuster**  
Specialized utility for adjusting frame timing and synchronization in Wan 2.1 video generation workflows.

### 🎭 Trent/Masks (1 node)

**Latent Aligned Mask**  
Creates precision masks aligned to latent space dimensions. Ensures proper mask scaling for latent-based video and image processing.

### 🎬 Trent/Keyframes (1 node)

**Wan Vace Keyframe Builder**
Dynamic keyframe sequencing for Wan Vace video generation. Features interactive UI with drag-and-drop image inputs, frame-accurate positioning, automatic resizing, and synchronized mask generation. Supports up to 256 frames with customizable filler frames.

### 🎤 Trent/LipSync (9 nodes)

Complete lip sync pipeline for non-human character animation. Converts audio to mouth shapes and composites them onto tracked positions in video frames.

**Audio To Phonemes**
Extracts phonemes from audio using Vosk speech recognition. Returns timestamped phoneme data for mouth shape mapping. Automatically downloads the required Vosk model on first use.

**Phoneme To Mouth Shapes**
Converts phoneme data to a sequence of mouth shape indices (A-H + X for silence). Maps speech sounds to the 9 standard mouth positions used in animation.

**Mouth Shape Loader**
Loads 9 mouth shape images from a folder. Expects files named A.png through H.png plus X.png (silence). Validates all shapes are present and correctly sized.

**Mouth Shape Preview**
Previews mouth shapes with their corresponding phoneme labels. Useful for verifying mouth shape assets before use.

**Mouth Shape Compositor**
Basic compositor that places mouth shapes on frames at a fixed position. Use for static characters or simple animations.

**Mouth Shape Compositor (Tracked)**
Advanced compositor with tracking support. Places mouth shapes at positions determined by either:
- **Point tracking**: Use tracked (x,y) coordinates from Point Tracker
- **Mask tracking**: Use per-frame masks from SAM3 to find mouth centroids

Features BiRefNet background removal, scaling, offset adjustment, and optional RGBA output for further compositing.

**Point Tracker**
Robust point tracking using pyramidal Lucas-Kanade optical flow. Click a point on frame 1 and track it through the entire video. Features:
- Sub-pixel accuracy with Scharr gradients
- Multi-stage recovery (adaptive template, original template, full-frame search)
- Periodic drift validation against original template
- GPU-accelerated template matching for large search areas
- Configurable window size up to 1025px for full-frame tracking

**Point Preview**
Click-to-pick interface for selecting the initial tracking point. Click anywhere on the image to set coordinates, which pass directly to Point Tracker.

**Points To Masks**
Converts point sequences to gaussian masks for use with mask-based compositing.

**Remove Mouth Background**
Standalone background removal using BiRefNet or color keying. Returns mouth shapes with alpha channel for custom compositing workflows.

2. **Phoneme To Mouth Shapes** - Convert to mouth indices
3. **Mouth Shape Loader** - Load your 9 mouth images
4. **Point Preview** - Click to select tracking point
5. **Point Tracker** - Track the point through video
6. **Mouth Shape Compositor (Tracked)** - Composite mouths onto frames
