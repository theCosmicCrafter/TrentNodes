**Batch Slowdown**
GPU-accelerated frame duplication to slow down image, mask, or latent batches. Supports multiple input modes: direct multiplier (2x, 3x, 1.5x), target frame count, or FPS conversion (24fps to 60fps). Features smart decimal distribution for non-integer slowdowns and optional speedup mode for sampling every Nth frame.

### 🎞️ Animation/Timing (2 nodes)

**Animation Duplicate Frame Processor**
Analyzes animation sequences to detect duplicate frames and timing patterns. Identifies frame holds and optimizes animation timing for smoother playback.

**Animation Frame Remover**
Removes duplicate or unwanted frames from animation sequences based on configurable thresholds. Cleans up animation batches for efficient processing.

### 🖼️ Trent/Image (4 nodes)

**Align Stylized Frame**
Aligns AI-stylized images back to their original subject position with pixel-perfect precision. Uses BiRefNet (BEN2) for high-quality subject segmentation, SD 1.5 inpainting for clean plate background generation, and area-based scaling with centroid positioning for accurate subject placement. Eliminates ghosting artifacts when compositing stylized subjects onto original backgrounds.

**Cherry Pick Frames**
Flexible frame selector with multiple modes for extracting specific frames from image batches. Supports first N frames, last N frames, specific indices (comma-separated like "0,5,10,75"), or every Nth frame. Dynamic outputs adjust based on your selection. Perfect for grabbing keyframes, endpoints, or evenly-spaced samples from video batches.

**Bevel/Emboss Effect**
Applies depth and dimensionality to images through configurable bevel and emboss filters. Includes adjustable angle, depth, and smoothing parameters.

**Image Batch Analyzer**
Comprehensive statistical analysis of image batches. Generates histograms, color distribution charts, and detailed reports on brightness, contrast, and color composition.

**File List**
Lists files in a directory with filtering options. Returns file paths for batch processing workflows.

**Create Text File**
Creates text files with custom content. Specify a file path and content to write. Automatically adds .txt extension if none provided. Creates parent directories as needed.

**Wan2.1 Frame Adjuster**
Adjusts frame amount to always satisfy Wan 4x+1 requirements by adding gray frames to the end of a batch; use a Get Frame Range from Batch node before combining video with the original amount of frames for less headaches when using Wan.

### 🎭 Trent/Masks (4 nodes)

**Latent Aligned Mask**
Creates precision masks aligned to latent space dimensions. Ensures proper mask scaling for latent-based video and image processing.

**Latent Aligned Mask (Advanced)**
Extended version with additional parameters for fine-tuned mask generation including feathering, inversion, and composite operations.

**Latent Aligned Mask (Simple)**
Streamlined mask creation with minimal inputs for quick latent-aligned masks in simple workflows.

**Latent Aligned Mask (Wan)**
Specialized variant optimized for Wan video model requirements with automatic 4x+1 frame alignment.

### 🎬 Trent/Keyframes (1 node)

**Wan Vace Keyframe Builder**
Dynamic keyframe sequencing for Wan Vace video generation. Features interactive UI with drag-and-drop image inputs, frame-accurate positioning, automatic resizing, and synchronized mask generation. Supports up to 256 frames with customizable filler frames.

### 📝 Trent/Text (2 nodes)

**Auto Style Dataset**
Generates 35 prompt strings for synthetic dataset creation. Reads prompts from an external config file and applies optional prepend/append text to each output. Perfect for batch generation of training data with consistent formatting.

**String List Cowboy**
Lassos strings together into a list with optional prefix/suffix branding. Works like Impact Pack's MakeAnyList but specialized for strings - connect any inputs and they get collected into a string list. Each string gets the prefix prepended and suffix appended. Dynamic inputs expand as you connect more values.

### 🧪 TrentNodes/Testing (1 node)

**LoRA Test Prompt Generator**
Generates 10 test prompts specifically designed to validate different types of LoRA models. Supports four LoRA categories:
- **subject_person**: Portrait/character LoRAs with varied lighting, poses, and environments
- **style**: Artistic style LoRAs across diverse subjects and scenes
- **product**: Object/product LoRAs with studio and lifestyle contexts
- **vehicle**: Car/vehicle LoRAs covering angles, lighting, and motion

Outputs 10 individual prompt strings plus a combined `all_prompts` output for easy batch processing. Includes optional quality suffix to append tags like "8k, detailed" to all prompts.
