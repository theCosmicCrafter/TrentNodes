## Nodes

All nodes are organized under the `Trent/` category for easy navigation.

### 📹 Trent/Video (7 nodes)

**Enhanced Video Cutter**  
Advanced scene detection with adaptive thresholding and motion analysis. Exports scenes as individual MP4 files with clean naming and comprehensive metadata tracking.

**Ultimate Scene Detect**  
High-precision scene boundary detection using configurable threshold algorithms. Identifies cuts, fades, and transitions in video sequences.

**Video Folder Analyzer**  
Scans directories for video files and generates detailed reports including resolution, frame rate, codec, duration, and file size. Outputs as text, JSON, or markdown.

**Latest Video Last N Frames**  
Extracts the final N frames from the most recently modified video in a specified directory. Useful for monitoring render outputs.

**Latest Video Final Frame**  
Retrieves the last frame from the newest video file in a folder. Streamlines iterative video generation workflows.

**Cross Dissolve with Overlap**  
Creates smooth frame transitions with configurable overlap duration. Blends adjacent frames for professional video effects.

**Enhanced Animation Timing Processor**  
Analyzes animation sequences to detect duplicate frames, timing patterns, and frame holds. Optimizes animation frame sequences.

### 🖼️ Trent/Image (2 nodes)

**Bevel/Emboss Effect**  
Applies depth and dimensionality to images through configurable bevel and emboss filters. Includes adjustable angle, depth, and smoothing parameters.

**Image Batch Analyzer**  
Comprehensive statistical analysis of image batches. Generates histograms, color distribution charts, and detailed reports on brightness, contrast, and color composition.

### 🔧 Trent/Utilities (7 nodes)

**Smart File Transfer (Auto-Rename)**  
Intelligent file management with automatic conflict resolution, checksums, and organized directory structures. Safely transfers files with duplicate detection.

**Custom Filename Generator**  
Creates structured filenames using templates with support for timestamps, counters, and metadata variables. Ensures consistent file naming across workflows.

**Filename Extractor**  
Parses filenames to extract embedded metadata, timestamps, and structured information. Converts filenames into usable workflow data.

**JSON → Multi-Line Summary**  
Converts complex JSON data into human-readable multi-line summaries. Formats nested structures for display and logging.

**JSON Extractor**  
Extracts specific values from JSON objects using path notation. Simplifies working with structured data in workflows.

**Number Counter**  
Generates sequential numbers with configurable start, step, and padding. Essential for batch processing and frame numbering.

**Wan2.1 Frame Adjuster**  
Specialized utility for adjusting frame timing and synchronization in Wan 2.1 video generation workflows.

### 🎭 Trent/Masks (1 node)

**Latent Aligned Mask**  
Creates precision masks aligned to latent space dimensions. Ensures proper mask scaling for latent-based video and image processing.

### 🎬 Trent/Keyframes (1 node)

**Wan Vace Keyframe Builder**  
Dynamic keyframe sequencing for Wan Vace video generation. Features interactive UI with drag-and-drop image inputs, frame-accurate positioning, automatic resizing, and synchronized mask generation. Supports up to 256 frames with customizable filler frames.
